Plugin provides [Cypher](http://www.opencypher.org/) query language support for Jetbrains IDE family.

**WARNING:** Currently plugin is in alpha-stage. If any bugs, incompatibilities or other issues occurs - report
by creating issue on Github.

# Features

* Cypher query highlight in `.cyp` files
* Cypher language injection into strings (Java, PHP and others)
* Parser errors for invalid Cypher queries

# Supported Jetbrains products

* IntelliJ IDEA - **tested**.
* RubyMine
* WebStorm
* PhpStorm
* PyCharm
* AppCode
* Android Studio
* 0xDBE
* CLion

Plugin is not tested (yet) with all existing Jetbrains products. However it should work
without any issues.

# Installation

Plugin should be available via Jetbrains repositories somewhere in near future.

# Development

Gradle is used as build system. 

```shell
# Build plugin distribution
./gradlew buildPlugin 

# Run idea in development mode
./gradlew runIdea
```

### Grammar

Cypher grammar is located here - `src/main/java/com/neueda4j/intellij/plugin/cypher/lexer/Cypher.bnf`

After grammar change:

* Generate parser code for grammar
* Generate jFlex `.lexer` for grammar
* Generate lexer code from `.lexer`
