# Roadmap

1. Stabilize grammar.
2. Make parser errors readable.
3. Code completion.
4. References (find usages/renaming/etc).
5. Grammar error recovery tuning.

# Development

Gradle is used as build system. 

```shell
# Build plugin distribution
./gradlew buildPlugin 

# Run idea in development mode
./gradlew runIdea
```

### Grammar

Cypher grammar is located here - `src/main/java/com/neueda4j/intellij/plugin/cypher/lexer/Cypher.bnf`

After grammar change:

* Generate parser code for grammar
* Generate jFlex `.lexer` for grammar
* Generate lexer code from `.lexer`
